 * so the customer (account) name is deliberately not resolved: doing so used to
 * page the entire account directory (`/accounts/search` has no ID filter, and
 * the case search view doesn't embed the account) to fill a field nothing
 * renders. If a Customer column is added, resolve the name from the search view
 * once it carries the account, not by scanning the directory.
 *
 * Search and the severity / state / case-type / project filters are pushed
 * into the search payload (searchQuery / severities / states / types /
 * projectIds) and the BE paginates the result (`pagination` → `total` /
 * `limit` / `offset` / `hasMore`).
 *
 * `page` is zero-based (matching MUI `TablePagination`); `pageSize` is the row
 * limit (≤ the backend's page-size cap, `BE_MAX_PAGE_LIMIT`). Cases are always sorted by `updatedOn`;
 * `sortOrder` (default `"desc"`) controls direction, so the cases page loads
 * the most recently updated cases on arrival by default but can be flipped
 * to oldest-updated-first. `enabled` is an optional escape hatch to suspend
 * the fetch.
