// Opens existing security report analyses and checks the header shows what it
// should.
//
// ✅ READ-ONLY. SRAs are opened by URL and asserted; nothing is created or
// modified, so this is safe to run repeatedly.
//
// A security report analysis reuses the case detail header, so the same locators
// apply — but it carries no severity chip, since security reports hide severity
// on the way in.
//
// What is and is not pinned:
//
// - **Subject** is pinned literally. Security report subjects are generated at
//   creation as `<deployment> - <product name> - YYYY-MM-DD`, so for an existing
//   record the string is fixed. The date in it is the SRA's *creation* date, not
//   today's — computing it would break the test the next day.
// - **WSO2 case id** and **case number** are asserted by format, since the values
//   differ per record. The id prefix is per project.
// - **State** must be one of the real case states, so a blank or placeholder
//   fails.
//
// Cloud Support has no entry: that project does not offer security reports at all
// (see the create spec), so it has none to view.
//
