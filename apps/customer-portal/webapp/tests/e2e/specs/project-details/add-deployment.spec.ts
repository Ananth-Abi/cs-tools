// The deployment lifecycle on the Deployments tab of the project details page,
// reached through the side nav as a user would: add, edit the description,
// rename and retype, create a non-production one, page the list, expand and
// collapse a card, and delete. A nested `validation` describe covers the modals'
// field gating and dismissal paths, and an `access` describe checks the tab is
// reachable per project type. Adding a product to a deployment is its own suite —
// see add-deployment-product.spec.ts.
//
// ⚠️ Writes to a REAL backend via POST /projects/{id}/deployments. Every test
// that needs a deployment creates its own so it can run alone, which is eight of
// them: add, edit-description, rename-and-retype, non-production create,
// expand/collapse, delete, and the two dismissal cases in `validation`. Only the
// delete test disposes of what it made, so a full run leaves seven behind.
//
// The rest create nothing: the six Add Deployment gating cases never submit, the
// pagination test only reads, and both access tests are read-only.
//
// "Delete" is a deactivation rather than a removal: it PATCHes
// `{ active: false }` to the same endpoint the edit modal uses, and the record
// drops out of the list. There is no DELETE verb, so the deployments left by the
// other tests can be tidied from the UI but not truly removed.
//
// The name carries a timestamp because the backend rejects a duplicate with
// `409 {"message":"A deployment with the same name already exists for the
// project."}` (confirmed live). A fixed name therefore only ever works on the
// first run; every later one failed, and — because the response wait originally
// required a 2xx — failed as an unexplained 180s timeout rather than as a 409.
//
// Everything that writes is scoped to Managed Cloud Subscription: the Add
// Deployment button is withheld for a Restricted project, and deployment access
// is a per-project feature flag. The read-only `access` describe runs against
// every project in DEPLOYMENT_ACCESS_PROJECTS, since it creates nothing.
