// Opens existing announcements and checks the header shows what it should.
//
// ✅ READ-ONLY. Announcements are opened by URL and asserted; nothing is created
// or modified, so this is safe to run repeatedly.
//
// An announcement reuses the case detail header — verified live: the header row
// reads `<wso2 case id> | <case number> <state>`, followed by the subject — so
// the same locators apply. It carries no severity chip.
//
// What is and is not pinned:
//
// - **Subject** is pinned. The same advisory is published to all three projects,
//   so they share it while each keeps its own number and id.
// - **WSO2 case id** and **case number** are asserted by format, since the values
//   differ per project. The id prefix is per project.
// - **State** must be one of the real case states, so a blank or placeholder
//   fails.
