// The attachment lifecycle on a case: upload, list, expand, collapse, download
// and delete — run against every project type.
//
// Two cases per project, and the split matters:
//
// - The **kept** case holds one upload permanently. The list, expand, collapse
//   and download tests all need a file to be there, and the expand test needs
//   specifically an image. Its upload is guarded on the file name, so a run only
//   uploads when the file is missing — otherwise every run would stack another
//   identical copy with nothing removing them.
// - The **delete** case is used for the upload-then-remove round trip, so it ends
//   exactly where it started. Kept separate so the delete never takes away the
//   fixture the other tests rely on.
//
// Attachments are the only records in this suite that can be deleted, which is
// what makes that round trip possible at all.
//
